## Email Service Architecture

### Components Structure
```
Email Service Integration
├── hooks/use-email.ts          # Email service hook
├── lib/email.ts               # Core email functionality
├── app/api/email/route.ts     # Email API endpoint
├── components/
│   ├── email-settings.tsx    # Settings management
│   ├── email-composer.tsx    # Email composition
│   └── daily-tasks.tsx       # Task notifications
└── app/page.tsx              # Main integration
```

### Data Flow
1. **Settings**: EmailSettings → localStorage → Main page state → DailyTasks
2. **Notifications**: Task actions → useEmail hook → API endpoint → SMTP service
3. **Composition**: EmailComposer → useEmail hook → API endpoint → SMTP service

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/email
Sends emails using SMTP configuration.

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "to": ["recipient@example.com"],
  "subject": "Email Subject",
  "html": "<p>Email content</p>",
  "text": "Email content"
}
```
